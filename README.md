# E-Commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
 The objective of my Excel project was to improve my proficiency in using 
spreadsheets and Excel's features for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Through 
this project, I aimed to enhance my ability to organize and manipulate data, perform 
calculations and analysis, and create visual representations of data using charts and 
graphs.

### Skills

- Excel Formulas
- Pivot Table
- Pivot Charts
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.
4. Removing  duplicate entries

## Data Processing:
 - I created a separate worksheet dedicated to the analysis and visualization 
of the ecommerce sales data. This worksheet served as the foundation for data processing 
tasks.
 - One of the key data processing steps I took was the creation of a pivot table. By 
utilizing Excel's pivot table feature, I was able to summarize and aggregate the bike 
sales data based on different variables such as sales data, customer demographics, and 
product details. This allowed for easier analysis and visualization of the data.
 - Additionally, I leveraged Excel's charting capabilities to create visual representations 
of the bike sales data. By selecting the appropriate chart types and configuring the data 
series, I was able to present the insights and trends in a visually appealing manner.
 - Throughout the data processing phase, I focused on generating meaningful insights 
and presenting them in a clear and understandable manner. Excel's functions, formulas, 
and features were utilized to manipulate and analyze the data effectively, enabling me 
to gain valuable insights from the bike sales dataset.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods

## Conclusion:
 - The Excel project focused on analyzing ecommerce sales data and presenting key insights 
using formulas, functions, pivot tables, and charts.
 - The project demonstrated the importance of data cleaning, organization, and visualization in facilitating data analysis and decision-making.
 - Through data cleaning, duplicate entries were removed, ensuring the accuracy and 
integrity of the dataset. The organization of data, such as categorizing age groups and 
converting abbreviations into full forms, improved data readability and comprehension.
 - The use of pivot tables and charts allowed for a comprehensive visual representation 
of the data, easily understand sales trends, product performance, and customer satisfaction ratings. 
 - Overall, the Excel project enhanced my understanding of spreadsheet functionalities, 
data cleaning techniques, and data visualization capabilities. It emphasized the 
significance of accurate and well-organized data in driving effective business decisions.
